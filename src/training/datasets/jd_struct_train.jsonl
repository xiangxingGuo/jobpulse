We apply and share diverse knowledge from many disciplines as we serve diverse clients with strategic and tactical marketing that bolsters growth, awareness, and sales. Our internships are arranged into departments, enabling collaboration between various related academic majors. Interns are given education-relevant training projects according to our internal operations and client activities during their internship. Ensuring an environment in which Interns can develop and gain practical experience in the real world.\nApply to One Position, Maximum: Do not apply for more than one internship position at a time. Apply to the one that interests you the most. Then, if you are invited for an interview, you may indicate interest in other positions at that time, and we can discuss which position would be best suited for you.\nMinimum Education and Experience: Applicants must be enrolled in a college or graduate program at the beginning of their internship. Previous internship experience is beneficial but optional. You must have completed some classes relevant to your internship prior to beginning and must show examples of what you know during your interview. The purpose of the internship is to provide training and experience that goes beyond classroom education. Therefore, we rely on each intern (you) to have mastered classroom-level fundamentals related to the internship prior to beginning it, so that you can participate with high-level instructions, minimal direction, and feedback from our professionals and your peers on a weekly basis as a way to learn and grow. We also expect you to fully follow the training materials provided by your syllabus, including taking self-directed learning where specified.\nProfessionalism Expectations: Internships are unlike the classroom and operate differently than what students do in school. Our internships are meant to challenge you, not to introduce you to a subject for the first time or to tell you exactly how to do everything from the ground up, but also do not expect you to know everything a seasoned professional will. We offer a hands-on experience where interns are empowered to take initiative, problem-solve, use resources, creativity, and personal judgment. After receiving instructions, we expect interns to find their own solutions to problems in collaboration with their peers. We also expect interns to speak up throughout an internship. We work closely with organizations whose mission is to speak and act in ways that take courage for the greater good and value members of our team who can do the same. You will receive individual guidance and feedback from our professionals including occasional meetings with the CEO. You’ll take on roles consistent with the internship but refined to align with current company projects as you collaborate within and across teams in accordance with the amount of initiative you demonstrate. You should be excited to learn new things and be able to take criticism. Our internships are meant to bridge the classroom to the workplace and are designed for those seeking the knowledge-level in between.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nWhy Is The Internship Application Description So Long? At NourishCap, we value transparency. and provide you with a wealth of great information up front so you can decide if our culture and internship might be a good fit for you. Giving you a long document up front also enables us to test your comprehension and retention of extension instructions; correspondingly, we provide extensive instructions throughout our internships.\nWhy Us?

In every internship with us, you’ll receive individual guidance and feedback to help you on your path to a professional career. You can participate in our training as an intern or a volunteer, using your time to make a difference. We are all linked, so help us help nonprofits help the world.\nWhy Participate Remotely? We are creating the workplace of the future. It is akin to what the CEO of the multi-billion dollar company Automattic calls Level 5. As a fully remote company for years, we have gone beyond the limits of traditional in-person experiences. We have developed great tools and regular check-ins to keep everyone connected, encourage flexible schedules, and overall enhance the employee experience. Our internship program is designed to give you not just freedom and community, but the kind of personal and professional growth that is only possible in a remote environment.\nWhat Do You Gain From This Experience?\nReal, Hands-on Experience: Rather than the coffee-fetching of a typical internship or the textbook learning of a classroom setting, we provide interns with hands-on experience with real projects. Each intern will have a main project along the lines of the title of the internship position to which they were accepted, plus several side projects, which together create diverse learning experiences. Moreover, your training and participation in our research and development can help nonprofits worldwide connect with donors, volunteers, constituents, and more.\nMake a Difference: By participating here, you can help a variety of organizations help the world on a larger scale than volunteering for any one nonprofit.

We are developing a first-of-its-kind system to help nonprofits and for-profits gain the publicity that is currently more desperately needed than ever.\nTeamwork and Mentorship: NourishCap enables you to work in small teams of typically 1 to 5 interns. You’ll meet regularly with fellow interns on your team. You’ll also meet weekly as a team to gain direct supervision and mentorship from the company’s CEO, senior staff members, and/or more seasoned interns.\nNetwork with Peers, Mentors, and More: NourishCap creates networking opportunities by helping you learn how to communicate effectively with executives. This skill will allow you to build lasting impressions and have direct interactions with staff members and fellow interns around the United States and the world. Interns often report connecting with more people in our remote internships than in physical classrooms of comparable size because of how we encourage and facilitate networking meetings.\nCompany Culture: NourishCap believes it’s crucial for interns to feel comfortable speaking up for what they believe in. We value suggestions for improvements on all aspects of our company and voicing opinions about projects in team settings. Additionally, we seek interns who can pursue the career growth they want and the courage to request the kind of work they want to do. NourishCap looks for intellectually honest individuals with a spirit of independence and interdependence.\nWorkplace Readiness Training: Employers expect students to understand communication soft skills and corporate culture; however, colleges offer few opportunities for students to learn day-to-day workplace fundamentals for behavior. As a result, we’ve developed something unique: our Rules-of-Thumb (RoT’s) training process. The RoTs are the otherwise unwritten rules of professional etiquette based on hard-learned experiences of industry professionals. We’re developing a book and a training system for explicitly teaching this kind of advice to our employees, interns, and eventually to others, which will be valuable for their future careers.\nResume Building: This internship will provide you with a multitude of experience regardless of the field that you wish to pursue. As stated earlier, you have the opportunity to gain both portfolio examples as well as a letter of recommendation upon completion. Giving you an amazing advantage for any future career endeavors. With these items previous interns have entered our nation’s top graduate programs and excellent post-graduation careers.\nLeadership Opportunities: In addition to encouraging each intern to demonstrate personal leadership within their team of fellow interns, NourishCap also has “Level 3: Management” internships in every department that people can apply to as long as they have participated in at least one prior internship with us. This advanced position gives smart, responsible interns training and practice for leading teams of other interns while under the supervision of a NourishCap supervisor.\nAcademic Credit: If you want work-study or school credit for the internship, we can almost always provide the kind of oversight your university would require. Some educational institutions require prior approval before the start of an internship. It is your responsibility to check with your institution to be sure you meet all requirements for participation before you interview with us. We do NOT require you to enroll in a class or get credit for your internship; some universities do require this of you, others make it optional, and still others do not allow credit.\nWhat does a typical day look like? There is no typical day, but there is a typical week.\nWhat does a typical week look like?\nYou will work either collaboratively in a team or independently on a project of your choice from a list that we will provide.\nEvery week, you will use your “Personal Syllabus” to complete weekly tasks and log your process.\nIn weekly team meetings, you will be guided by senior Bashpole team members who have years of experience and will act as your supervisors. You may ask questions about department supervisors during your interview. In weekly team meetings, you’ll show your syllabus log to your team via a screenshare and show, get feedback on, and take notes for the next steps with your project.\nIn addition, you'll have intern-only meetings throughout the week to collaborate with your peers, review each other's work, and answer each other's questions.\nEvery other week, we will have an “All Hands and Rule of Thumb (RoT) Meeting” where all interns will work collaboratively on the Rule of Thumb (RoT) book. The book contains our advice about corporate culture and communications soft skills: these are mostly from lessons we learned the 'hard way' in the workplace, things that no one taught us in college classes but that most employers expect you to know.\nWhat are the schedule expectations for this internship?\nWe have team and individual meetings every week via Google Meet. We expect you to be generally available for meetings during US Eastern time business hours.\nAside from scheduled meetings, you will have your choice of daily start and stop times; you can create a routine that works for you as long as you prioritize your internship.\nFor internships taken during the fall or spring, it is recommended to participate part-time. For internships during the summer, it is recommended to participate full-time. However, Internships can be a mix of part- and full-time, depending on what best suits your schedule.\nManage your schedule well to fulfill the weekly internship time you agree to.\nInternship start and end dates are flexible according to your university’s calendar for classes.\nWhat is the expected time commitment?\nWe offer both part and full-time internships with rolling start dates (starting whichever week of the year works best for you) and can generally work around your class schedule, as long as you commit to a routine\nYou can switch from full-time to part-time, or vice versa, as long as the duration adds up to a total of at least 400 hours, with 480 hours preferred.\nIf full-time: strongly preferred in summer and available throughout the year, 40 hours/week (or whatever is the maximum your college allows) lasts for about 3 months.\nIf part-time: during school sessions, 12-20 hours/week (or whatever is the maximum your college allows) for about 6 months.\nWhen may I get started? If NourishCap makes you an internship offer, you may start either as soon as you like or later in the year when your schedule permits: we have an orientation/onboarding meeting almost every Thursday for new interns.\nWhen will I start a project? Your first week will consist of onboarding and getting familiar with the environment of the internship, including the team and company resources. After about 1-2 weeks, projects are assigned to you during the weekly team check-in meetings. These weekly sessions allow you to meet with your team to discuss plans, tasks, and feedback.\nWho is more likely to succeed in this internship position?\nPeople with:\na genuine interest in the nonprofit consulting sector\nclassroom experience relevant to this position\nproactive mindsets that like their voices to be heard\ndetailed note-taking habits\ntime management skills who are organized and dependable\nan eagerness to take initiative with their ideas and communicate early and often\nHow does the interview process work? First, suppose an applicant meets our preliminary qualifications. In that case, we send them a message via Handshake with detailed instructions for setting up an interview that must be followed precisely; otherwise, we will decline the interview. Generally, each applicant has at least one interview during which their aptitude and knowledge are evaluated. If this goes well, the applicant will be given a follow-up task to examine how much they understand about our company and their position. Then, NourishCap may send a decision on an internship offer within a few business days.\nIf I apply, what are the odds I’ll be accepted? NourishCap posts its internship positions to nearly 1,200 colleges across the USA and receives hundreds of applications for each position for each season of the year. We generally select between 1 and 5 people per position per season (Winter/Spring, Summer, or Fall/Winter). Although our interviews are friendly and conversational, there are many factors that we carefully consider before, during, and after each interview. If you are selected for an interview, there is no guarantee that you will be given an offer. Upon selection for an interview, we will send you a message with everything you need to do to prepare for your interview, and you will be expected to follow all of the instructions thoroughly. It would be best if you took some time to prepare for your interview.\nCan I participate in more than one position? Not simultaneously; you may only participate in one position at a time. However, we welcome and encourage sequential internships, meaning participating in one team at one time and then another team at another time.\nHow will I be supervised, and who will be my supervisor? Each team will report directly to their department manager (who will be your supervisor) every week by screen-sharing a log about their training and accomplishments. (See also “What does a typical week look like?” above.) Your manager may be assisted by other team members and sometimes by interns who are more senior than you, so treat them all as sources of authority. If you ever have concerns about your peers or supervisors, you can contact people at any level of the organization. We prefer that everyone communicate early and often about their concerns and accomplishments!\nHow often will I work with supervisors compared to other interns? This varies from position to position and changes from the beginning to the end of a typical internship; however, generally, you will meet with your supervisor for at least one, if not several, hours a week. You will meet with fellow interns for at least a few hours a week, if not up to about half of the time per week that you spend on your internship. You will work on your own projects and training the rest of the time. If you want to spend more (or less) time working directly with others, let your supervisor know; they can sometimes make adjustments. We encourage you to collaborate with others as often as possible.\nWhat are the challenges to expect? Interns grow by dealing with and working through such challenges; this is how the real world works. This internship will take hard work and sometimes will be an imperfect experiment in training. There may be occasional communication at odd hours due to time differences and urgent matters. There will be more intern-intern interaction than with supervisors, and you can expect a mix of training from supervisors and finding and developing training yourself. Tasks may sometimes be vague and unclear, as some assignments will be new. Real people run our organization — and while we are not perfect — we intend to work hard and be the best we can be. We look for interns who have the humility to admit the same about themselves.\nWhat have previous interns said? Check out testimonials from our company’s other division on their careers page: https://promotermotor.com/openings-and-internships\nThere are no costs of any sort to participate in our internships, ever. Our internship is like a class that you get to take for free. Yet, even though our internships provide substantial experiential learning, we recognize that personal financial situations are sometimes an obstacle. If this concerns you, check with your career services center and academic advisers about whether your college offers any form of support that helps students take unpaid internships. Some colleges have scholarships, grants, stipends, or options for gaining class credit; some do not; either way, there are never fees nor expenses of any kind related to our internships, and you should be wary of any company that would try to charge you for anything for an internship.\nWhy is it an unpaid internship? NourishCap is a for-profit company that’s rebranding itself, which explains the start-up-like environment. Due to these circumstances, we currently don’t provide compensation. In lieu of payment, we provide interns with rich learning experiences such as receiving mentorship, the responsibility to create training, strong recommendation letters based on performance, and the opportunity to graduate with advanced management-based experiences. We are also newly offering a monetary bonus program that all our team members at NourishCap are aware of and eligible for. NourishCap dba Bashpole Software, Inc. complies with all US Department of Labor Federal Internship Guidelines per https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm.\nWhat if I’m an international student? International students are encouraged to apply for any and all internships. Show your university this internship description and check with them about their requirements. If selected, confirm everything is approved through your university before beginning an internship. NourishCap will provide documentation for the university in the form of an internship offer agreement.\nNon-Discrimination Policy: All nonprofits we serve are required to be compliant with Google’s non-discrimination policies, meaning that NourishCap works with a diverse set of nonprofits, such as nonprofits working with crime to mental health issues to combating misinformation. Thus, NourishCap interns are expected to be non-discriminatory themselves and help us serve any nonprofit that fits the eligibility guidelines. See more at https://nourishcap.com/home.\nDue to the volume of applicants, there can sometimes be a backlog that causes delays in our responses or no interview time openings for days to weeks, so read our several internship descriptions thoroughly, decide which if just one position fits you really well, and apply for that one. Please apply for only 1 position at a time, even if you are interested in several, and you can apply at any time of year. Applicants must be at least a college freshman before applying and be enrolled or planning to continue to enroll as an undergraduate or graduate student to be eligible to participate in our internships, not graduated permanently. If you are invited to interview, we prefer you schedule a time with us about halfway between now and when you might want to begin an internship. You may send us a message with your questions at any time. Please do not schedule interviews or informational meetings with us via “Meet Us” calendar links on the NourishCap website; those are for our prospective clients. Instead, carefully follow the instructions herein. See: https://nourishcap.com/openings.\nPlease apply to our positions via Handshake, not email, if possible. See also below. Initially, you don't need to submit your resume or unofficial transcript via Handshake. If we decide to take the next steps in the application process, we will ask you to supply those materials then. We prefer to have these materials sent via email to confirm that method of communication between you and our team.\nWhen applying on Handshake, ensure your GPA is visible to employers. GPA is one of the many factors we consider when screening candidates and reviewing applications. We encourage you to show your GPA on Handshake so that employers who consider a student’s GPA will review your application.\nIf you seek credit or are on a visa, check with your school's Internship Coordinator before interviewing to determine if this position satisfies the criteria. Many of our past interns have received credit through many universities, but you must check with yours individually. We do not require you to pursue credit nor do we guarantee that you’ll receive it; however, we have always successfully assisted those who have sought it in conjunction with internships with us.\nTo Apply: You must be a student for the duration of your internship and must not have permanently graduated. Interns – whether interested in one or multiple internships – will require only a single, one-hour first interview. If you meet these criteria, then 1) if you have access to Handshake, follow the instructions there. Doing so is part of the interview process and test. Or 2) if not, email hr2@PromoterMotor.com with a note that you do not have access to Handshake, a polite self-introduction message, and apply here: https://forms.gle/dCoRGHKFDx41Ryis9. You will not be offered an interview if you do not include all of the requested information.\nWe look forward to reviewing your application!\nLess\n\n\nRemember:\n- Short, compact, structured\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"role_title\": \"Software Engineering Internship 1.B\", \"company\": \"NourishCap\", \"location\": null, \"employment_type\": \"Full-time and Part-time flexible participation\", \"remote_policy\": \"100% Remote\", \"responsibilities\": [\"Collaborate with others on a variety of projects\", \"Prioritize and execute tasks in the software development life cycle\", \"Improve software project management tools and processes\", \"Navigate diverse workplace with varying time zones and cultural backgrounds\", \"Build strong connections with other interns and staff people\", \"Attend regular meetings to network and work alongside other teams\", \"Perform general administrative support\", \"Gain hands-on experience with real-world projects\"], \"requirements\": [\"Enrolled in a college or graduate program\", \"Completed some classes relevant to internship\", \"Show examples of what you know during interview\", \"Master classroom-level fundamentals related to internship\", \"Follow training materials provided by syllabus\", \"Speak up throughout internship\", \"Take criticism positively\", \"Have proactive mindset\", \"Have detailed note-taking habits\", \"Have time management skills\", \"Be organized and dependable\", \"Eager to take initiative\", \"Have eagerness to communicate early and often\"], \"preferred_qualifications\": [\"Genuine interest in nonprofit consulting sector\", \"Proactive mindsets\", \"Detailed note-taking habits\", \"Time management skills\", \"Organized and dependable\", \"Eagerness to take initiative\", \"Eagerness to communicate early and often\"], \"skills\": [\"JavaScript\", \"Google Apps Script\", \"Google Sheets Formulas\", \"HTML\", \"CSS\", \"AI\", \"GoHighLevel\", \"Google Tag Manager\", \"Google Analytics\", \"Google Ads\", \"SQL\", \"WordPress\", \"Google Meet\", \"Meeting recording software\", \"Pair Programming\", \"Communication\", \"Reading and Writing Comprehension\", \"Creative Problem Solving\", \"Time Management\", \"Organization\", \"Coordination\", \"Service Orientation\"], \"years_experience_min\": null, \"degree_level\": \"College or Graduate\", \"visa_sponsorship\": null}"}]}

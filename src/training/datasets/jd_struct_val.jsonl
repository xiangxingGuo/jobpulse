We stay ahead of what ’ s next, providing fresh insights to spark new ideas. We ’ re a trusted partner to our clients, working behind the scenes to bring imagination, depth, and clarity to their biggest challenges — in entertainment, technology, lifestyle, sports, and gaming. Together, we create with confidence.\nWe’re proud of our company’s values – these values guide us as we navigate sunny days, gray skies and everything in between:\n• Do what you love. With conviction.\n• Where discovery lives. And impact drives.\n• Celebrate difference. Cultivate belonging.\n• Big thinking. Collectively inspired.\n• Embrace the journey. Be human.\nThe Opportunity\nAt NRG, we’re always on the lookout for sharp, curious, and creative minds who are excited about diving deep into what makes audiences tick—across entertainment, technology, gaming, sports, and beyond.\nThis posting is for future opportunities across all of our client services teams. We’re always on the hunt for great talent and are excited about the possibility of teaming up in the future. If you’re passionate about qualitative and quantitative research and working with a team that partners with the world’s top brands to shape content, products and strategies that fuel cultural conversations, we want to hear from you!\nBelow is a snapshot of what a typical Research Analyst or Senior Research Analyst role looks like at NRG. The specifics may shift depending on the hiring needs, but this should give you a sense of what we’re about and what we’re looking for. If you don’t hear back for several weeks, don’t worry – we regularly review general applications but prioritize active openings. If there is a potential fit when a position opens, we’ll be in touch!\nYour Impact\n• Support all phases of quantitative and qualitative research projects, including research design, questionnaire and discussion guide development, data analysis and storytelling.\n• Projects may include methods such as concept evaluation, brand studies, content optimization tests, messaging/positioning evaluation, creative materials tests, market sizing and segmentation.\n• Help drive quality control processes at each step of the research lifecycle, from checking survey programming logic, questionnaire proofing, number checking and proofing reports and presentations for accuracy.\n• Partner with internal and external operations teams (programming, fieldwork, facilities, moderators, data processing) to drive projects forward on stringent timelines.\n• Assist with translating data into clear, actionable insights and recommendations through visual, creative and story-driven reports.\nWho We're Looking For\n• Prior Experience – Prior internship or work experience in market research or consumer insights is preferred. If you are a recent graduate but don’t have relevant work experience, we would love to hear about academic qualitative or quantitative research projects, such as primary survey research, experimental psychology studies, social media analysis, ethnographic research, or any other relevant projects.\n• Curiosity and Critical Thinking – You are genuinely interested in seeking information on the “whys,” always digging for more information to understand what makes consumers tick. Whether it’s understanding why one marketing message is more effective than another or what consumers think we could be using AI for in the future, you can always find something interesting to sink your teeth into. Simply put, you love to learn.\n• Clear and Proactive Communicator – You have excellent written and verbal communication skills and are able to communicate clearly and succinctly. You’re comfortable asking questions and sharing your point of view.\n• Data Driven – You’re comfortable working with data to identify trends and insights, including both structured (i.e. data and hard numbers) and unstructured (i.e. interviews and qualitative) data. Experience visualizing data with tools such as Excel, PowerPoint, Google Docs and Slides is preferred.\n• Data analysis techniques and software – Familiarity with any of the following data analysis techniques would be awesome: statistical significance testing, correlation analysis, multivariate analysis techniques (such as cluster/segmentation analysis) and conjoint and discrete choice analysis. Experience with statistical packages, like SPSS or Q, are a plus.\n• Problem Solver – You are a natural problem solver. When something doesn’t go as planned, your first instinct is to look for a solution, rather than viewing it as a roadblock. You’re always on the lookout for new ways to accomplish tasks and have the ability to address issues using creative and collaborative tactics.\n• Self-starter – Internally-motivated who continuously strives to get things done well, regardless of challenges encountered. You are proactive and always keep an eye on the next step.\n• Hawk-eyed attention to detail – You notice when font sizes change unexpectedly or a proper noun isn’t capitalized. Errors don’t get past you and you are always focused on ensuring high levels of quality control and reporting.\n• Expert multitasker – Successfully manages time and multiple competing priorities to ensure deadlines are always met. Staying organized is a must for managing projects!\n• Great Team Member – T eam player who works collaboratively and harmoniously within a team and across teams. You are comfortable forming connections with colleagues remotely whether that be jumping on a quick video meeting, picking up the phone for a call or chatting with them through IMs. You welcome feedback because you have a zest for learning and growing. You will roll up your sleeves to help get the job done and no task is beneath you.\n• Your degree(s) – You have a B.A./B.S. degree in areas such as Social Sciences, Psychology, Business, Marketing, Market Research, Statistics, Economics or a r elated field. Additional degrees are welcome!\n• Passion – A passion or desire to learn about technology, entertainment, gaming, sports and/or lifestyle sectors. You enjoy or are excited by the prospect of staying up to date on industry trends and developments.\nPosition Type\nThis is a full-time, exempt position.\nWhat We Offer\nWe embrace the current era of work and what it means to be a best-in-class employer.
